## CTCI Notes

### Resume
#### Resume tips: gaining strong experience

Without a great resume there is no interview.
And without great experience, there's no great resume.

- Take the Big Project Classes
- Get an Internship
    do everything you can to land an internship early in school. It will pave the way for even better internships before you graduate.
- Start Something
    build a project on your own time, participate in hackathons, or contribute to an open source project.
    It doesn't matter too much what it is. The important thing i that you're coding.


####  Resume tips: strong bullet points

For each role, try to discuss your accomplishements with the following approach:
**"Accomplished X by implementing Y which led to Z"**
Show what you did, how you did it, and what the results were. Ideally, you should try to make the reults "measurable" somehow.

#### Projects section

The projects should include your 2 - 4 most significant projects.
State what the project was and which languages or technologies it employed.
You may also consider including details such as whether the project was individual or a team project, and whether it was completed for a course or independently.
NOTE: These details are not required, so include them ONLY if they make you look better, independent projects are generally preferred over course projects, as it shows initiative.

*What should you build?*
It honestly doesn't matter. Different employees like different types of projects.
The most important thing is that you're building something.
